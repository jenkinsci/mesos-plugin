    Specifies the additional JVM arguments (e.g., Jenkins master authentication credentials) to be used when invoking the Jenkins slave agent on the Mesos slave.  <b>NOTE:</b> Any references to the "Xmx" JVM argument will be removed so that the maximum heap size available to the slave will be set dynamically based on the available memory.  The available memory is derived from the following calculation:  Jenkins Slave Memory in MB + (Maximum number of Executors per Slave * Jenkins Executor Memory in MB).
